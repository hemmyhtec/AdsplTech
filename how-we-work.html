                                            list of user-facing features, necessary administrative functionality, and general platform foundations. For this activity, the goal is to determine which features are critical to the business and customers,
                                            and this helps us start thinking about how to define the Minimal Viable Product.

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Needs: Must have, top priority</li>

                                            and product owners. We’ll reorganize everything, write new cards as needed, throw cards away and ultimately end with a high-level roadmap for the project. We’ll record all these cards on the Tracker board, which

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>Our highest priority is to deliver valuable, working software in a predictable way. We believe customers should be able to change their requirements, even late in development, because their business environment is constantly changing.</p>

                            <h3>Why Agile?</h3>
                            <p>
                                The best products are built when business stakeholders and product teams work in a highly collaborative way. For all of these reasons (and many more), we strictly adhere to an Agile software development approach.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Agile software development is an approach that’s based on making incremental improvements to a product with frequent cross-functional check-in points. Instead of planning every detail of a product at the beginning of the project, the Agile methodology
                                allows for changing requirements over time and relies on constant feedback from stakeholders and end users
                            </p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>With Agile development, cross-functional teams work on an iteration — a single development cycle — of a product over a period of time. Work to be done is organized into a backlog, which is prioritized based on business or customer
                        value. The goal of each iteration is to produce a working product.
                    </p>
                    <p> When using an Agile approach, business stakeholders and the product team must work together to align the product with customer needs and company goals. </p>

                        <h2>Lean Development</h2>
                        <p>The concept of lean software development emphasizes optimizing efficiency and minimizing waste in the development of software. The approach has its roots in the lean manufacturing movement, but is now considered a key part of the
                            Agile software development methodology. Lean principles aim to streamline every part of the software development lifecycle, centering on the idea that less is more.</p>

                        <h2>Extreme Programming</h2>
                        <p>Extreme Programming is a disciplined approach to delivering high-quality software, quickly and continuously. It promotes high customer involvement, rapid feedback loops, continuous testing and planning, and close teamwork. Software
                            is delivered at very frequent intervals — typically every one to three weeks. Ultimately, it creates flexibility for changing business and product needs. It provides insights into the cost and time to build out features and
                            deploy them.</p>

                        <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
                        <p>We plan to use pair programming (sometimes simply called “pairing”), an agile software development technique where two programmers work together at a single workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer,
                            reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While it may seem like an ineffective use of resources, pair programming can increase project velocity because coding mistakes are caught
                            and fixed immediately.</p>
